      <h1>Buying a new violin or viola? <small><i>by Mr. Benefield</i></small></h1>
      <article>
        <p class="style4 f-fp">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style36"><a href="http://www.time.com/time/globalbusiness/article/0,9171,1101030825-476423,00.html">Read an article in Time Magazine about Gliga - click here</a></p>
        <p class="style45">Many parents have asked me for a suggestion on buying a new, upgraded, quality violin. There are many stores in the area that sell violins. Feel free to buy one anywhere you like. I am not telling you where to buy a violin. I am only using my experience to steer you in the right direction. I have found a violin made by Gliga that is imported from Romania. The instrument plays very well throughout the positions and gets a dark rich vibrant sound. In it's price range, it is the best instrument I have heard. Most instruments in the under $1,000.00 price range are heavily varnished and give off a very bright sound. The Gligas give off a dark and rich sound. Again, feel free to buy a violin anywhere you like and any model or brand you like. I have found a store that sells these instruments at an extremely low price. The models are outlined below.</p>
        <p class="style46">DO NOT BUY FROM THE WEBSITE. THE PRICES ARE HIGHER. CALL THEM AND SAY YOU ARE FROM LAS FLORES MIDDLE SCHOOL AND QUOTE THE PRICES LISTED BELOW OR ON THE PRICE LIST!</p>

                <p class="style50">You would also need to buy and install a Wittner tailpiece with fine tuners at a cost of $35.00 -$40.00</p>
                <p class="style50">If there violins are well cared for, they should hold their value and in some cases be worth more than you paid for them. They are one of the best values I have seen.</p>
                <p class="style52 f-lp">Again, feel free to buy a violin anywhere you like and any model or brand you like. This suggestion is only because you have asked for it.</p>
